/**
 * This is the client API class for reporting build trace information.
 * <p>
 * Clients can use the static methods in this class to report build trace related events and related information during
 * the build execution. These methods will record the events and handle them accordingly in an internal manner.
 * <p>
 * If the build execution is not set up to produce a build trace, the methods will return instantly. The methods will
 * attempt to return as fast as possible to avoid delaying the build itself. This may result in the build trace events
 * being cached, buffered, or otherwise reported in an implementation dependent manner.
 * <p>
 * The methods of this class will <b>never</b> throw any exceptions.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Functions in this class (unless stated otherwise) rely on internal {@linkplain InheritableThreadLocal
 * inheritable thread locals} to appropriately record the build trace information. If you spawn new threads that don't
 * inherit these thread locals then some information may not be properly recorded in the build trace. <br>
 * <b>Note:</b> This mechanism is planned to be changed in a future release to not require inheritable thread locals.

	 * <p>

	 * they can perform longer running operations in cases where they need to.
	 * <p>
	 * Some examples for transformation tasks are:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Tasks which extract some files from an archive.</li>
	 * <li>Task that constructs a file tree in the required format based on some inputs.</li>
	 * <li>Tasks that convert files or other information to a different encoding or format. (E.g. convert JSON to
	 * XML)</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * In general transformation tasks don't perform compilations, or overall data validations, but rather change the
	 * representation of the data to a format that can be consumed in a specific way.
	 * <p>
	 * Transformation tasks are usually not displayed in the build trace, unless they throw exceptions or emit warnings.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that tasks that derive resources based on their inputs, or perform meaningful operations on them are
	 * recommended to be classified as {@linkplain #CLASSIFICATION_WORKER worker tasks}. E.g. a task that creates a ZIP
	 * archive based on its inputs should be classfied as worker task. However, if the ZIP is created for the sole
	 * purpose of consuming by another task, then it should be a transformation task.
