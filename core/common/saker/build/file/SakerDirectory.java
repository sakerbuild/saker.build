/**
 * Interface for directory file representation in the build system.
 * <p>
 * Directories contain children files which can be manipulated with the appropriate methods.
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link SakerFile}, none of the methods in this interface will cause implicit synchronizations. Trying to
 * retrieve contents of a directory will result in an {@link IOException} with unsupported message.
 * <p>
 * Directories track their children and employ lazy loading for populating their table. When the build execution is
 * started, the root directories are determined by the execution configuration. The directories do not load their
 * contained files immediately at construction time, but employ a lazy loading to fill this table. This behaviour is
 * called populating the directory, and is always happening implicitly.
 * <p>
 * Populating can occur in the following ways:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Partial population</li>
 * <li>Full population</li>
 * </ol>
 * Partial populating occurs when a specific file is accessed by name. This results in reading the attributes of the
 * file from the file system and adding the file to the table if it exists. Partial population does not occur if a
 * directory is already fully populated.
 * <p>
 * Full populating occurs in any other cases, e.g. retrieving all children, removing a file). Full populating can occur
 * for a directory at most once in its execution lifetime.
 * <p>
 * The populating behaviour only affects files which have not yet been modified by the user. If a task decides to
 * overwrite a file with a new directory, then that directory will be treated as an empty fully populated directory.
 * <p>
 * During synchronization of directories, a file system folder will be created at the specified path. A snapshot of the
 * files will be taken, and those will be synchronized accordingly. The synchronization methods can accept a
 * {@link DirectoryVisitPredicate} as a parameter to control which files and subdirectories should be synchronized.
 * Synchronizing a directory will delete any files at the child path that is not present in the in-memory representation
 * of the directory, unless the {@link DirectoryVisitPredicate#getSynchronizeFilesToKeep()} specifies othervise.
 * <p>
 * The synchronization of directories are often executed in parallel, using a thread pool.
 * <p>
 * Instances of {@link SakerFile} can be checked if they represent a directory by using the
 * <code>(file instanceof {@link SakerDirectory})</code> expression on them.
 * <p>
 * When designing tasks for remote execution it is strongly recommended that directories are accessed through methods of
 * the {@link SakerPathFiles} utility class.
 * <p>
 * Clients should not implement this interface, at all. Directories should not be treated in any other way, as just a
 * container for files.
 *
