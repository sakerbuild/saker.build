/**
 * Interface for file representation in the build system.
 * <p>
 * The build system maintains an in-memory representation of the file system that the tasks should use. The tasks should
 * compute their outputs and use this file representation hierarchy to store the file outputs. The purpose of this
 * representation is to increase performance by reducing I/O load, and appropriate caching (other optimizations may
 * apply as well).
 * <p>
 * During a lifetime of a file it may have only one parent. In its initial state it is constructed without any parent
 * directory. It can be attached to a parent via {@link SakerDirectory#add(SakerFile)} or similar methods. They can be
 * removed from its parent after they've been attached via {@link #remove()}, but once they have been removed, they
 * cannot be reattached to another directory. If one needs to move a file, the {@link DelegateSakerFile} should be used,
 * and the original file removed. Note that directories cannot be moved in this way.
 * <p>
 * The contents of files might be stored anywhere. In memory, on disk, over the network, etc... <br>
 * It is important that each file has a location where it resides in the build system. This location is specified by
 * {@link #getSakerPath()}. <br>
 * This location can be mapped to a file system storage location where it should actually reside if the in-memory
 * representation didn't exist. As the outputs of tasks are collected in the in-memory hierarchy, it is required to
 * synchronize the files to their corresponding location. This process is called synchronization.
 * <p>
 * During synchronization the contents of the file will be persisted to the appropriate location in the file system. The
 * target location is specified by the execution configuration and the path of the file. The synchronization process
 * includes checking if the current file residing at the location has the same contents as the in-memory file. If they
 * match, then no I/O will be done. If the contents differ then the contents of this file will be written out to the
 * target location. Synchronizing multiple times while the contents of the disk is unchanged by external agents, should
 * be a no-op.
 * <p>
 * During synchronization, the {@link ContentDescriptor} of the file is used to determine if the file has changed.
 * <p>
 * This interface modifies the behaviour of the content methods specified by {@link FileHandle}. Calling these methods
 * may implicitly synchronize the contents of the file, and will retrieve the contents in the most efficient way.
 * <p>
 * Implicit synchronization can be avoided by the caller by invoking the introduced content retrieval methods with the
 * <code>Impl</code> suffix. <br>
 * Implicit synchronization can be also avoided by the subclass by overriding {@link #getEfficientOpeningMethods()}
 * method. <br>
 * Implicit synchronization does not occur for files that aren't attached to a parent. I.e. if {@link #getSakerPath()}
 * returns a relative path at the time of calling when retrieving the content, the implicit synchronization is not
 * employed.
 * <p>
 * The base directories for working with files are available from the exection and task contexts.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface can be checked if they represent a directory by using the
 * <code>(file instanceof {@link SakerDirectory})</code> expression on them.
 * <p>
 * When designing tasks for remote execution, and accessing contents of a file it is strongly recommended to use the
 * utility methods in {@link TaskExecutionUtilities}, instead of calling it directly on this interface. Doing so can
 * result in increased performance, as the build runtime can employ caching and improve overall network performance.
 * <br>
 * It is recommended to make files RMI-transferrable when executing remote tasks, by overriding
 * {@link #getRemoteExecutionRMIWrapper()}. Implementations should not directly declare RMI transfer properties for the
 * classes themselves. (I.e. do not RMI annotate the class, but only override {@link #getRemoteExecutionRMIWrapper()})
 * <p>
 * Clients must not directly implement this interface, but extend the {@link SakerFileBase} abstract class. Implementing
 * this interface directly can and will result in runtime errors.
