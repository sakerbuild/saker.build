/**
 * Provides access to executional services provided by the build runtime.
 * <p>
 * Execution context is to be considered as a parent of {@link TaskContext}, it is created for each build execution.
 * <p>
 * The execution context provides the following functionalities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Accessing the build configuration</li>
 * <li>Managing script target configurations</li>
 * <li>Evaluating execution properties</li>
 * <li>Providing access to loaded repositories</li>
 * <li>Root directory management</li>
 * <li>Execution-wide related features (e.g. appropriate caching)</li>
 * <li>Other executional services which have a longer lifetime than task execution, but do not necessarily outlive
 * execution lifetime</li>
 * </ul>
 * The execution context is used to retrieve target configurations for build scripts. It does appropriate caching to
 * ensure validity during the execution. See {@link #getTargetConfiguration(TaskContext, SakerFile)} for more
 * information.
 * <p>
 * {@linkplain ExecutionProperty Execution properties} can be evaluated using the execution context, which will be
 * cached during the lifetime of the execution.
 * <p>
 * The execution context holds references to the loaded build repositores for this execution. They are mapped to their
 * {@link String} identifiers specified by user configuration. See {@link #getLoadedRepositories()}.
 * <p>
 * The execution context provides access to the root directories of the in-memory file hierarchy. They should be used
 * tasks to handle file in- and output. The root directories are determined based on the user provided path
 * configuration. See {@link ExecutionContext#getRootDirectories()}.
 * <p>
 * Clients should not implement this interface.
