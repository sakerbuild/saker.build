/**
 * Output stream implementation that delegates its calls to a primary, and multiple secondary output streams.
 * <p>
 * This class acts as a simple forwarding output stream for the priority/primary output stream, and acts the same way as
 * {@link MultiplexOutputStream} for the secondary streams.
 * <p>
 * Then a call is issued to this stream, it is forwarded to the priority stream. After that, all of the secondary
 * streams are called for that operation. If any of the secondary streams throw an exception, it is <b>not</b>
 * propagated to the caller, but can be retrieved later by calling {@link #getSecondaryException()}.
 * <p>
 * If the priority stream throws an exception during the call, it is propagated immediately, and the secondary streams
 * are not called.
 * <p>
 * If the secondary streams threw an exception for a call, then they will not be called for future operations. Meaning,
 * that if a secondary stream threw an exception, all of them may be in an inconsistent state.
 * <p>
 * This class closes all the output streams it was constructed with (both primary and secondary).
 * <p>
 * This stream class is not thread safe.
