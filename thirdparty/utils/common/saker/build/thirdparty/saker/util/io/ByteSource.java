/**
 * Interface for handling byte stream input.
 * <p>
 * Byte source is similar to {@link InputStream}, but is defined as an interface for allowing stream operations over
 * RMI. RMI solutions can create proxy objects for network transferred objects only for interfaces, therefore it was
 * necessary to declare such an interface that is usable for this use-case.
 * <p>
 * This interface works in similar ways as the {@link InputStream} class, but is designed to be RMI compatible. The
 * interface also contains extra method(s) for more efficient implementations of common use-cases (like
 * {@link #writeTo(ByteSink)}).
 * <p>
 * To convert between {@link InputStream} and {@link ByteSource} objects use the static methods declared in this
 * interface.
 * <p>
 * Byte source implementations are not thread-safe by default.
 * 
 * @see ByteSink
