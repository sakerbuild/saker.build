/**
 * {@link OutputStream} implementation that takes write requests and executes the writing to a subject stream
 * asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class is created for a given output stream. The class will spawn its own thread that executes the
 * write operations to the given stream.
 * <p>
 * When a write request is issued to this stream, it will take the bytes from the argument, and copy them to an internal
 * buffer. The internal buffer is asynchronously flushed to the subject output stream on the flusher thread.
 * <p>
 * Any exceptions which are thrown by the subject stream may be reported asynchronously in any future write, flush, or
 * close operations. Therefore callers should be noted, that an exception thrown from a method of this class may not be
 * directly related to the actually called method. Any exception occurring on the flusher thread will be rethrown as
 * {@link AsyncOutputIOException}.
 * <p>
 * When the async output stream is closed, or {@link #flush()} is called, all the pending write operations will be
 * finished before that method returns. Closing this stream will shut down the flusher thread, and close the subject
 * stream as well.
 * <p>
 * Using this class can be advantageous when the subject stream may block during write operations, and the caller could
 * proceed with its work instead of waiting for I/O.
 * <p>
 * If the callers fail to properly close this stream, the flushing thread will automatically quit when the
 * {@link AsyncOutputStream} instance is garbage collected. (The flushing stream is also a
 * {@linkplain Thread#setDaemon(boolean) daemon thread}.)
 * <p>
 * The flushing stream is started with a {@linkplain Thread#setPriority(int) low priority}, therefore longer delays can
 * occurr if the CPU is doing more important work.
